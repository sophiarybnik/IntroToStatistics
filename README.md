The following report contains the derivation of the Fisher Information matrix, the Gamma distribution and the maximum likelihood estimation of its parameters given a set of data. Additionally, an analysis of the relationship between oil prices and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, respectively, was conducted. In the report, we build a simple linear regression model for both cases. 

Beyond the financial data part of the report, the main topic covered was hypothesis testing. The test statistics and their distributions are built under the assumption of the null hypothesis. Additionally, in cases where the sample size is large, the CLT is applied.
